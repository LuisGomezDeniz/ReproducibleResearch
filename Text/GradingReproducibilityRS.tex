\section{Introduction}
	
\IEEEPARstart{R}{eproducibility} is at the core of experimental sciences. 
It is also a basilar element of scientific integrity. 
The advent of data science is leading to new requirements and practices able to cope with the challenges posed by huge volumes of data, often of dynamic nature. 
	
Modern grounds for Reproducible Research were set before the widespread use of deep learning and other massively data-based techniques. 
	
Among the efforts made towards building Remote Sensing Reproducible Research environments, one may mention Code Ocean and GRSS Remote Sensing Code Library. 
These two initiatives belong to the IEEE scientific ecosystem. 
	
However, is this enough for healthy science in Remote Sensing? 
We do not think so. 
Many authors continuously strive to disseminate their research findings in such a way that any user will be able to validate them at a later stage. 
This includes the proposal of software architectures, the use of open data, FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software), and other initiatives.

\section{How to Start Writing a Reproducible Article}

Starting well saves lots of time.
Here we make simple recommendations that may save time and efforts.
We assume that you use \LaTeX\ and \BibTeX.

The main idea consists in having a single repository for all the scientific texts you write: 
theses, 
reports, 
articles, 
letters,
reviews,
and miscellaneous documents.

Fig.~\ref{Fig:StructRepo} illustrates the recommended basic structure for a repository holding several \LaTeX\ files (or projects), along with their associated data and code.

Every directory may contain specific subdirectories.
For instance, \verb|Data| may contain \verb|CSV|, \verb|text|, and other directories with specific data files.

Notice that there is a single \BibTeX\ file (with extension \verb|.bib| in the \verb|Common| directory).
\BibTeX\ references can be split on several files, but these files should be common to all projects.
This avoids outdated and redundant bibliographic data bases.

Every article should be in its pwn directory.
Avoid using the name of the journal where you will submit your work for the directory and document names, as the destination may change along the process.

Data, figures, images and code should be common to all projects, as one typically reuses them.

Check Ref.~\cite{EditorialGRSL2015} for naming convention and revision handling of submitted manuscripts.
