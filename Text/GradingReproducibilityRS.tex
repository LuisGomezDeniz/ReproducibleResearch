	% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
	% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
	% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
	% 
	% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
	%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
	%
	% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
	% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
	% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
	% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
	% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
	% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
	% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
	% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
	% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
	% space somehow managed to creep in.

	\section{Introduction}
	
	\IEEEPARstart{R}{eproducibility} is at the core of experimental sciences. 
	It is also a basilar element of scientific integrity. 
	The advent of data science is leading to new requirements and practices able to cope with the challenges posed by huge volumes of data, often of dynamic nature. 
	
	Modern grounds for Reproducible Research were set before the widespread use of deep learning and other massively data-based techniques. 
	
	Among the efforts made towards building Remote Sensing Reproducible Research environments, one may mention Code Ocean and GRSS Remote Sensing Code Library. 
	These two initiatives belong to the IEEE scientific ecosystem. 
	
	However, is this enough for healthy science in Remote Sensing? 
	We do not think so. 
	Many authors continuously strive to disseminate their research findings in such a way that any user will be able to validate them at a later stage. 
	This includes the proposal of software architectures, the use of open data, FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software), and other initiatives.
		
	Universally accessible and informative web page containing:

			\item Start date, state (in preparation, active, finished)

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Title
			\item Authors (all authors with contact: at least, email and institution) with their institutions (at least one institution with address: that of the corresponding author)
			\item Abstract

		\item Computational platform (machine, model, operating system, software, libraries, and versions)
		\item Code (with comments)
		\item Data
		\item Which software components are FLOSS or free (including operating system)?
		\item How to install and run the code (instructions and examples)
		\item How to read and modify the data \item How to generate the plots, images (where they improved for visualization? how?), and tables (rounding, truncating, etc.)
